# Blackjack
Python tutorial for creating a blackjack game

This is for an exercise on Angela Yu's Python course. It is a 'capstone' project, incorporating every element learned on the course.

I have not included dicts in the program. I am in the process of determining the best way to implement them. I have decided that they
should be used in place of the string concatenation. Currently I am using a mix of fstrings and string variables to print the player
and computer scores. This is incredibly janky, and stems from the fact that I did not want to use dicts whatsoever. On the other hand,
I should probably use them because it will make me a better programmer in the long run. So I am going to find a way to incorporate them
and do away with the hacky score reporting.
